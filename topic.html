        <p>PROTECT NATURE (environmental sustainability)

            Pakistan is vulnerability personified when it comes to environmental climate change. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events imperil the country's fragile ecosystem. The 2022 floods, which affected 33 million people and caused $30 billion in damages, exemplify the devastating consequences of climate change. Pakistan's glaciers, which supply 75% of its freshwater, are melting at an alarming rate, threatening water scarcity and agricultural productivity. Heatwaves, like the 2015 Karachi tragedy that claimed 1,200 lives, are becoming more frequent. Deforestation, industrial pollution, and unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbate these issues. Climate migration, food insecurity, and health crises loom large. To mitigate these impacts, Pakistan must prioritize renewable energy, reforestation, climate-resilient infrastructure, and adaptive agricultural practices. International cooperation, climate finance, and grassroots activism are essential for safeguarding Pakistan's ecological integrity and ensuring a livable future. <br>
            Pakistan is the country where climate problems barely comes to rest  and this polluted environment is becoming poison for our food crops too. People and government of Pakistan did a lot efforts for Pakistan’s environmental sustainability  like,</p>

        <p>1. We can make our environment healthier by reusing the plastic wastes  this will conserve landfill space and reduce plastic waste</p>

        <div>
        <img src="./New folder/12.jpg" alt="" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>2. Use of AI and drones in our agriculture can help us alot in maintaining a proper system. <br> This is will help in our crop yeilds and in our water management system while reducing environmental problems</p>

        <p>4. ⁠The most easiest way of reducing environmental problems is planting , when it comes to do planting it doesn’t mean to do planting on a larger level .  We can do planting in our offices , schools college  university homes playground streets and other places like this too .</p>
    </div>
    <p>Other than ideas like these we can find new idea this this too for eg , A man in Pakistan spent his 2000 rs only on bringing a pipeline of a Mosque’s wuzu (wudu) water to a garden . He noticed that the water of wuzu (wudu) was being wasted so he thought of reusing that water for plants . Just like this we can create our own ways to save greenry and climate of our country. <br>Pakistan is constantly facing  environmental problems some due to the natural disasters too  , if this all is creating major problems in our lives  then on other hand these natural disasters are provided us various changes to make differences in our societies too , this all gives us chance to take action 
        We can make changes by controlling our carbon footprints too. If we can reduce our carbon footprint then we can help in preventing similar natural disasters in future too .</p>

        <img src="./New folder/15.jpg" alt="" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>What is a Carbon footprint? <br>For this what best we need to do is switch to renewable energy resources like wind turbines and solar energy</p>

        <p>These environmental friendly options will not only help our environment to become healthier <br> but will also  help us to achieve our environmental goals and will make our lives easier for us and our future generations. <br>
